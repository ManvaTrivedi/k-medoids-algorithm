# k-medoids-algorithm
Implementation of this program gives clustering solution using k-medoids algorithm


•	The program will take two inputs: a data file containing multiple continuous features and a value for k.<br>
•	Then, it calculates the dissimilarity matrix and then applies the k-   medoids algorithm.\n
•	The clustering process continues until cluster assignments do not change or maximum 100 iterations have been completed and calculates average silhouette width for the final clustering solution.\n
•	The program adds a new column containing cluster ids (1, 2, 3, …, k) to the original input file and save it to clusters_k.csv, where k is the number of clusters.\n
•	Finally, the program shows average silhouette width in the console.\n
